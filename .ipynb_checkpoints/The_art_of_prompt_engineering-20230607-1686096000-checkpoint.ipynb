    "\n",
    "Introduced by Google researchers in 2022, CoT prompting prompts the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final answer to a multi-step problem. This method enables models to decompose multi-step problems into intermediate steps, enabling them to solve complex reasoning problems that are not solvable with standard prompting methods.\n",

    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Self-consistency prompting | Sample multiple diverse reasoning paths and select the most consistent answers. | If the task is to predict the weather, the model might generate multiple predictions like \"It will rain\", \"It will be cloudy\", and \"It will be sunny\". The model then selects the most consistent answer. |\n",
    "| Least-to-Most prompting (LtM) | Specify the chain of thought to first break a problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. | If the task is to solve a complex math problem, the model first breaks it down into simpler subproblems, solves each one in sequence, and then combines the solutions to solve the original problem. |\n",
    "| Active Prompting | Determine which questions are the most important and helpful ones for human annotation. | If the task is to write a detailed report, the model first identifies the most uncertain areas (e.g., specific data points or arguments), asks for human annotation on these areas, and then incorporates the annotated information into the final report. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generated Knowledge Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the generated knowledge prompting is to ask the AI to generate potentially useful information about a given question/prompt, and then leverage that provided knowledge as additional input for generating a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to write an article about cybersecurity, particularly cookie theft. Before asking the AI to write the article, you can ask it to generate some dangers and protections against cookie theft. This will help the AI write a more informative blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these techniques, a new method called \"Prompt Tuning\" has been introduced, which involves learning \"soft prompts\" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signal from any number of labeled examples. This approach outperforms GPT-3's \"few-shot\" learning by a large margin and becomes more competitive with scale. As models exceed billions of parameters, this method matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned) [source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08691).\n"

    "- The survivor function, denoted S(t), is the probability that the event of interest has not yet occurred by time t.\n",
    "- The hazard function, denoted h(t), is the event rate at time t conditional on survival until time t (i.e., the risk of the event per time unit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis takes into account censoring, which occurs when we have some information about individual survival time, but we don’t know the survival time exactly (for example, if a patient is still alive at the end of the study, or if a customer has not yet churned by the time data were collected).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis has applications in many fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Medicine**: This is the field where survival analysis is most used. It's often used to measure the fraction of patients living for a certain amount of time after treatment. In this context, the event of interest is often death, but can also be the occurrence of a disease, or recovery from surgery.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Biology**: Survival analysis can be used to measure lifetimes of species.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Engineering**: In reliability engineering, it can be used to analyze time-to-failure data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Marketing and Business**: Survival analysis can be used to predict customer churn and understand customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Social Sciences**: It can be used to analyze the time until events like marriage, divorce, or retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods used in survival analysis, including the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the Nelson-Aalen estimator, and Cox proportional hazards models. These methods have different strengths and assumptions, and the choice of method depends on the specifics of the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. It allows for varying survival times and can handle censored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Nelson-Aalen estimator is another non-parametric statistic used to estimate the cumulative hazard function in survival analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cox proportional hazards model (or Cox regression model) is a semi-parametric model that allows the inclusion of multiple covariates and assumes that the effects of the covariates are multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate and are constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, survival analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing time-to-event data, with applications in many fields. It's particularly useful when dealing with censored data, which are common in many research areas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the basic principles and techniques used in survival analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Survival Function (S(t))**: This is the probability that a subject survives from the time origin (t=0) to a specified future time t. Survival function is defined as S(t) = Pr(T > t), where T is the random variable denoting the time of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hazard Function (h(t))**: This is the event rate at time t conditional on survival until time t or later (i.e., T ≥ t). It can be interpreted as the risk of dying at time t. It is formally defined as the derivative of the survival function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Censoring**: This is a type of missing data problem common in survival analysis. Right censoring is the most common type, which happens if a patient is still alive (or the event has not occurred) at the end of the observation period. The exact survival time for this patient is not known, but it is known to be longer than a certain time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kaplan-Meier Estimator**: This is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. In medical research, it is often used to measure the fraction of patients living for a certain amount of time after treatment. The estimator is named after Edward L. Kaplan and Paul Meier, who each submitted similar manuscripts to the Journal of the American Statistical Association. The journal editor, John Tukey, convinced them to combine their work into one paper, which has since been cited over 50,000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Log-Rank Test**: This is a hypothesis test to compare the survival distributions of two samples. It is used to test the null hypothesis that the survival distributions are the same across the groups. The test statistic is a sum of the observed and expected number of events in one of the groups at each observed event time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: This is a semi-parametric model developed by Sir David Cox in 1972. It allows us to estimate the hazard (or risk) of death, based on the values of covariates for each individual. The model's name is derived from the proportional hazards assumption, which implies that the hazard functions of individuals are proportional and the ratio of hazard functions is constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Accelerated Failure Time Model (AFT)**: This is a parametric model that provides an alternative to the Cox model. Instead of modelling the hazard function, the AFT model focuses on the survival time. The model assumes that covariates have a multiplicative effect on the survival time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parametric Survival Models**: These are models that assume a particular distribution for the survival times (e.g., exponential, Weibull, Gompertz). They can provide a better fit to data than the Cox model if the distributional assumption is correct, and they can provide more interpretable summaries of effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the basic principles and techniques used in survival analysis. The choice of technique depends on the specifics of the problem at hand, including the nature of the data and the research question.\n",
